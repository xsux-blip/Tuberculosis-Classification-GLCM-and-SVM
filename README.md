# Andrew Bintang Pratama - Tuberculosis Classification Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Machine Learning project developed for the classification of Tuberculosis (TB) using medical images. The model was built to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing TB through the detection of patterns in medical imaging, leveraging advanced algorithms like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automated handling of image data for input into the classification model.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes CNN for accurate feature extraction and image classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes precision, recall, and accuracy for comprehensive model evaluation.
- **Scalability**: The model is designed for easy integration with larger systems, making it adaptable for real-world applications.

## Project Components
- **files/**: Contains necessary resources and data used in training and testing the model.
- **model_klasifikasi/**: Includes the saved trained models used for classification purposes.
- **modules/**: Python scripts responsible for the modular execution of tasks such as preprocessing, training, and testing.
- **Main.py**: The main script that runs the entire classification pipeline.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For model development and experimentation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning frameworks used for CNN model implementation.
- **Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)**: Used for feature extraction in image analysis.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Another method explored for classification.
